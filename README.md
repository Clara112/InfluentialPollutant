# Model-Selection
The main goal of this project is to pick the best model according to forward, backward, stepwise selection and LASSO from a large dataset (n = 864) using R. 

pollutants.csv is the dataset.  

Report.pdf is the report which summarizes the findings of the analysis. (the file is quite blurry though :( as I lost the Rmd file :()

Appendix.Rmd is the file where my teammates and I did the analysis.

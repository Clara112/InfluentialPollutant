# Model-Selection
The main goal of this project is to pick the best model according to forward, backward, stepwise selection and LASSO from a large dataset (n = 864). Afterwards from this model, the most influential pollutant is chosen.

pollutants.csv is the dataset.  

Report.pdf is the report which summarizes the findings of the analysis.

Appendix.Rmd is the file where my teammates and I did the analysis.
